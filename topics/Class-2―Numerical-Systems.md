# Class #2â€•Numerical Systems

## Decimal System
<p>Generally, we are used to working with numbers in a decimal format, where each position is 
represented by ten to the power of the position, <code>we start from right to left, 
starting from 0</code>, this then mean that we multiply each digit by a ten raised to some 
zero-based power.
<br/><br/>
These are known as <i><b><code>position-based system</code></b></i> that are based on the 
position in which the number we are working with has been placed and not with the value entirely.
Then we can transform any number in its decimal representation to any numerical system.
<br/><br/>

## Binary System
<p>Binary systems only have two symbols in their alphabet, 0 and 1, which can be though of as 
<code>on and off states</code>. Therefore, the ten is replaced with a 2 (for the number of 
symbols we have) and through this we can effectively have a number in decimal represented in 
binary</p>


## Hexadecimal System
<p>16 symbols in its alphabet, 0 through 9 and A,B,C,D,E,F representing numbers from 0 through 
15, these can be used to represent binary numbers associating them in groups of four numbers.
<br/><br/>
Memory is internally stored and numbered through hexadecimal locations (addresses), you can 
think of these as the long addresses that are even used for error messages in some computers.
</p>

## Octal System
<p>Octal system has eight symbols in their arsenal, effectively all numbers from o to 7 as it 
uses 3 bits to encode itself. Therefore, we can transform binary to octal grouping every three 
characters.
<br/><br/>
The octal system is important as <code>its used in Linux to store codes that represent file 
permissions for users, groups and admins.</code>
