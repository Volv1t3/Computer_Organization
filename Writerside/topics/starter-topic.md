## Course Description
<p>This course takes a look at the most basic and fundamental aspects of 
Computer 
Organization.
In 
contras to computer architecture (often related to the interaction between components on a firmware 
level), computer organization takes a look at the core components (physical components) in a computer.
<br/>
<br/>
The core idea then is <code>study the underlying components, and how we can control them through 
Assembly, of our computers</code>. Here we will learn how to program using <code>Assembly (a 
language that gets us closer to the way our CPU function)</code>.
<br/><br/>
Effectively, we will use this language to transform basic operations like addition, subtraction, 
and loading and storing information to <code>program complex tasks and programs</code>
</p>

## Practical Components 
<p>While most of the information will, of course, be theoretical, we will also apply the 
concepts we learn in projects, snippets, and homework pieces in the language 
<code>MARIE</code> through the page <shortcut>Marie.js</shortcut>. This page gives us a 
simplified view of a computer, provides an <b>instruction set</b>, and examples that we can use 
to study.
<br/><br/>
These will be the building blocks to construct complicated programs. The goal then, is to learn 
how the CPU handles complex tasks using simple instructions like move or add
<br/><br/>
In the end these will be the practical components of this course

<list>
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Homework</format></b>: Additional content used to 
prepare us and grade our progress in this class.
</li> 
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Tests</format></b>: Two tests worth 25% each, we cannot 
use notes on these but the instruction set will be given to us.</li> 
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Classwork and Autonomous Work</format></b>: Classwork 
done in class and some small projects we start in class and are for our personal study</li> 
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Final Project</format></b>: 25% of our grade final 
project about this course, most likely programmed in <b>MARIE</b></li>
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Final Exam</format></b>: The final exam is reserved only 
to those whose grade is a D pondered near the end of our semester, those with A,B, or C  
<code>do not have to give the exam</code>. On the other hand those lower than a D 
<code>also cannot give this exam</code></li> 
</list></procedure>

## Considerations
<procedure title="Considerations For This Class" collapsible="true">
<list>
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">D2L</format></b>: is the main method of communication for 
homework, testing, practices, and classwork. We <code>cannot turn in anything through 
eMail or WhatsApp</code></li> 
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Project Presentation</format></b>: has to be done with 
<code>all group members present</code>, if only one comes the others get a zero.

On the final exam, out of a group of three 
<code>one comes up and explains the code 
while the other two modify it</code>
</li>
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Phones and Computers</format></b>: are not allowed, the 
only exception is when someone is pregnant and requires immediate attention. Computers 
<code>cannot be used aside from taking notes if they have a touchscreen</code>. No typing, no 
clicking of keys during classes (unless told to do so). </li>
<li><b><format color="CornFlowerBlue">Out-of-Class Meetings</format></b>: If we were to 
require one, we should send an email <code>at least two hours before the requested 
meeting time</code>, to allow for any scheduling changes.</li>
